# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for Spyder2000. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Line 6 patent-based nonlinear distortion with adaptive pre-clipping filtering
- Parameters specified: Gain (0-10 → 3-40dB), Tone (0-10 → ±12dB tilt @ 680Hz), Level (0-10 → -∞ to 0dB)
- UI vision captured: POD-inspired glossy bright red finish in 1590b stompbox enclosure
- Use cases identified: Boost mode (low gain) for modern high-gain guitarists, distortion mode (high gain) for classic rock/blues

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start Stage 0 DSP research and planning (`/plan`)
3. Start implementation directly (requires mockup or quick params first)
4. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Audio Effect (Guitar Overdrive/Distortion)
- Core concept: Line 6 patent nonlinear function with adaptive pre-clipping IIR filter (parallel shelving + peak with gain-dependent crossfading)
- Signal flow: Input → Pre-clip filter → Oversampled nonlinear → Tilt tone → Output level
- Oversampling: User-selectable quality mode (2x/4x/8x/adaptive)
