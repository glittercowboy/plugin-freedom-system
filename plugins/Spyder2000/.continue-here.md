# Resume Point

## Current State: Stage 0 - UI Design Complete

UI mockup v1 finalized and implementation files generated. Parameter specification locked. Ready to proceed to Stage 1 (Foundation + Shell).

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Line 6 patent-based nonlinear distortion with adaptive pre-clipping filtering
- Parameters specified: 3 parameters (gain, tone, level)
- UI vision captured: POD-inspired glossy bright red finish in 1590b stompbox enclosure

**Stage 0 (Research & Planning):** ✓ Complete
- Plugin type: Audio Effect (Guitar Overdrive/Distortion)
- Complexity tier: 3 (MODERATE research depth)
- Complexity score: 5.0 (Complex - phased implementation required)
- Professional examples researched: FabFilter Saturn 2, Soundtoys Decapitator, iZotope Trash 2, Line 6 POD Farm
- JUCE modules identified: juce::dsp::Oversampling, juce::dsp::IIR::Filter, juce::dsp::WaveShaper
- DSP components documented: 5 components (adaptive pre-clipping filter, nonlinear waveshaper, oversampling, tilt filter, DC blocking)
- Architecture specification created: architecture.md
- Implementation plan created: plan.md with 3 DSP phases

**UI Mockup:** ✓ v1 Finalized
- Version: v1
- Window: 450×300px (non-resizable)
- Layout: Horizontal (3 knobs)
- Style: POD-inspired glossy Ferrari Red
- Controls: Gain, Tone, Level rotary knobs
- Special: 7-segment display showing "INSANE"
- Files: v1-ui.yaml, v1-ui-test.html
- Status: **FINALIZED** (ready for Stage 3 integration)

**Implementation Files Generated:** ✓ Complete
- parameter-spec.md: Full specification locked from v1 mockup (3 parameters)
- v1-ui.html: Production WebView interface (POD-inspired glossy red design)
- v1-PluginEditor.h: C++ header with correct member order
- v1-PluginEditor.cpp: C++ implementation with JUCE 8 patterns
- v1-CMakeLists.txt: WebView build configuration
- v1-integration-checklist.md: Stage 3 implementation guide

**Key architectural findings:**
- Line 6 patent formula unavailable (using tanh waveshaping as industry-standard approximation)
- 8x oversampling recommended for heavy distortion (reduces aliasing)
- Parallel filter topology with gain-dependent crossfading (exponential curve)
- Tilt filter implementation: Two biquad shelves @ 680Hz with opposite gains
- Estimated CPU: ~50% single core @ 48kHz (acceptable)
- Latency: ~10-20 samples from oversampling (host-compensated)

## Next Steps

1. **Stage 1: Foundation + Shell** - Run `/implement Spyder2000`
   - Create CMakeLists.txt with juce_dsp module dependency
   - Generate project structure (PluginProcessor, PluginEditor)
   - Implement APVTS with 3 parameters (gain, tone, level)
   - Configure BusesProperties (stereo input + stereo output)

2. **Stage 2: DSP (3 phases)**
   - Phase 2.1: Core Processing (waveshaper + output level + DC blocking)
   - Phase 2.2: Filtering System (pre-clipping adaptive filter + tilt filter)
   - Phase 2.3: Oversampling Integration (8x oversampling + latency compensation)

3. **Stage 3: GUI (single-pass)** - Integrate WebView UI from v1 mockup
   - Copy v1-ui.html to Source/ui/public/index.html
   - Replace PluginEditor files with v1 templates
   - Configure CMake with v1-CMakeLists.txt
   - Follow v1-integration-checklist.md (8 sections, 50+ verification steps)

4. **Validation** - Automatic after each stage

## Context to Preserve

**Plugin Architecture:**
- Type: Audio Effect (Guitar Overdrive/Distortion)
- Input/Output: Stereo in, stereo out (dual-mono processing)
- Processing: Time-domain nonlinear waveshaping with oversampling
- Real-time requirements: Latency-compensated (10-20 samples)
- State: Stateful (IIR filter state + oversampling buffers)

**DSP Components:**
1. Adaptive Pre-Clipping Filter (parallel treble shelf + midrange peak + crossfading)
2. Nonlinear Waveshaper (tanh, 8x oversampled)
3. Tilt Filter (two biquad shelves @ 680Hz)
4. DC Blocking Filter (20Hz highpass)
5. Output Level Control (simple gain)

**Processing Chain:**
Input → Adaptive Pre-Clipping Filter → [Upsample 8x] → Waveshaper → [Downsample] → Tilt Filter → DC Blocking → Output Level → Output

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Phased implementation (complexity score 5.0 requires phases)
- 3 DSP phases (Core → Filtering → Oversampling)
- Single-pass GUI (WebView integration from finalized v1 mockup)

**Risk Factors:**
- Line 6 patent formula unknown (fallback: tanh waveshaping)
- Oversampling CPU cost (target: <60% single core, fallback: quality modes)
- Adaptive filter crossfading tuning (requires subjective listening tests)
