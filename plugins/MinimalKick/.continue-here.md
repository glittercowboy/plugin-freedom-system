# Stage 4 Phase 4.1 Complete - Core Synthesis

Basic kick drum synthesis implemented (no pitch modulation yet):
- Sine wave oscillator (juce::dsp::Oscillator)
- Amplitude envelope (juce::ADSR, AD config)
- MIDI handling (note-on triggers, monophonic)
- Parameters: attack, decay (working)
- Parameters: sweep, time, drive (unused, for next phases)

**Next:** Phase 4.2 (Pitch Envelope - exponential decay, highest complexity)
