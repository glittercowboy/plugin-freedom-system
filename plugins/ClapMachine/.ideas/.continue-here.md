# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for ClapMachine. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Dual-section 808-style clap with independent filtering
- Parameters specified: 18 total controls (flam, body, mix/output sections)
- UI vision captured: Dual-panel layout, vintage aesthetic with modern clarity
- Use cases identified: House production, retro 808, experimental textures

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start implementation directly
3. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Synth (Instrument)
- Core concept: Dual-section architecture (flam generator + noise body)
- Dual multimode filtering: Independent LP/BP/HP filters with resonance per section
- Wide parameter ranges: 0-100ms flam timing, +/- 24 semitone pitch, 2-5 adjustable layers
- MIDI response: Velocity → volume only (simple, predictable)
- Presets: 3-5 starting points for common use cases

**Files Created:**
- plugins/ClapMachine/.ideas/creative-brief.md
- PLUGINS.md entry added

**Architecture Notes:**
- Flam section: Layered transients with timing spread, stereo width, independent filter
- Body section: Noise generator (white/pink/brown) with tone, decay, independent filter
- Mix stage: Balance, drive/saturation, pitch shift, output level
- Each section has full multimode filtering (LP/BP/HP + resonance)
