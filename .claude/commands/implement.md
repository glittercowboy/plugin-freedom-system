# /implement

When user runs `/implement [PluginName?]`, invoke the plugin-workflow skill.

## Preconditions

**Check PLUGINS.md status:**
- Plugin MUST NOT exist, OR
- Plugin status MUST be 💡 Ideated

**If plugin exists and status is 🚧:**
Reject with message:
```
[PluginName] is already in development (Stage [N]).
Use /continue [PluginName] to resume the workflow.
```

**Check for creative-brief.md:**
```
plugins/[PluginName]/.ideas/creative-brief.md
```

If missing, offer:
```
No creative brief found for [PluginName].

Would you like to:
1. Create one now (/dream [PluginName])
2. Continue without brief (not recommended)
```

## Behavior

**Without argument:**
Present menu of plugins with 💡 status or offer to create new plugin.

**With plugin name:**
Verify preconditions, then invoke plugin-workflow skill at Stage 0.

## The 7 Stages

The plugin-workflow skill executes:
1. **Stage 0:** Research (15-30 min) → research.md
2. **Stage 1:** Planning (5-10 min) → plan.md
3. **Stage 2:** Foundation (10-15 min) → CMakeLists.txt, structure
4. **Stage 3:** Shell (5-10 min) → Compiling skeleton
5. **Stage 4:** DSP (30 min - 3 hrs) → Audio processing
6. **Stage 5:** GUI (20-60 min) → WebView interface
7. **Stage 6:** Validation (20-40 min) → Pluginval, presets, docs

## Contract Enforcement

**Stage 1 Planning BLOCKS if missing:**
- parameter-spec.md (generated by ui-mockup finalization)
- architecture.md (generated by Stage 0)

If blocked, prompt:
```
Cannot proceed to Stage 1 - missing implementation contracts:

Required before implementation:
✓ creative-brief.md exists
✗ parameter-spec.md (generate by finalizing UI mockup)
✗ architecture.md (generate by completing Stage 0)

Next step: /dream [PluginName] to create UI mockup and finalize it.
```

## Pause & Resume

Between each stage, ask:
```
Continue to Stage [N]? [Y/n]
```

If user pauses, update .continue-here.md and exit.

User can resume with `/continue [PluginName]`

## Output

By completion, you have:
- ✅ Compiling VST3 + AU plugins
- ✅ Working audio processing
- ✅ Functional WebView UI
- ✅ Pluginval compliant
- ✅ Factory presets
- ✅ Git history with all stages
